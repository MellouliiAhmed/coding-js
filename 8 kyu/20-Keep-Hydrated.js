// Keep Hydrated!

// Nathan loves cycling.

// Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

// You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.


function litres(time) {
    return Math.floor(time/2 );
  }

  console.log(litres(3));


//   Math.floor() is a function in JavaScript that returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
