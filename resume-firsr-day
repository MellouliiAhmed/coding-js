//arr.filter((x)=> x > 0) => this will return a list of positives elements => [1,7,12] 

//.reduce((acc, current) => acc+current, 0)=> acc: is the number in the array that I will start with for this exemple 0 , current is the current number

//(acc,current)=>acc+current => this is a callBack function

//sort((a,b)=>a-b)=> This is an array sorting method using a comparator function (a, b) => a - b to sort elements numerically in ascending order.
//.slice(1,-1)=> create a new array without the first element and the last element

//s.repeat(n)=> string will be repeated n times


//n.toString(): Converts the number n to a string.
//.split(""): Splits the string into an array of individual characters.
//.map((m)=>Number(m)): Converts each character back to a number.
//.reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the array.
